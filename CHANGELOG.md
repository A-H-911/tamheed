[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

_Nothing yet._

## [1.0.0] - 2026-06-22

First stable release. The methodology, schemas, identifiers, and handoff contract are now stable; future
changes ship with a migration note per the versioning rules in `references/governance.md`.

### Changed
- **Downstream executor is now Claude Code (no longer agent-neutral).** Keystone targets **Claude Code**
  (CLI/IDE; cloud coworker acknowledged) as the agent that implements the plans it produces, because
  Keystone is itself a Claude Code plugin. The handoff layer leans into Claude Code: the **agent-control
  surface** is now `CLAUDE.md` **importing** `AGENTS.md` (the file Claude Code auto-loads — Anthropic's
  documented idiom) instead of the prior "AGENTS.md-canonical + CLAUDE.md-shim" pair; the initial /
  follow-up / review prompt templates reference plan mode, TodoWrite, subagents, and a code-review pass
  where useful (named as capabilities, never hard-depended on). Safeguard 13 ("coupling to one agent")
  and the Warn gate `G-COUPLING` are reframed: coupling to Claude Code is now an intentional *harness*
  choice. Updated `SKILL.md`, `README.md`, `plugin.json`/`marketplace.json`,
  `references/{safeguards,quality-gates,handoff,prompt-templates,workflow,artifact-catalog,artifact-rules}.md`,
  `docs/{methodology,workflow}.md`, the handoff templates, and `init_skill_repo.py`.
- **The produced plan stays portable.** Requirements, architecture, and ADRs remain vendor-, provider-,
  and stack-neutral (safeguard 15); the bootstrap stays repo-provider-neutral (safeguard 14). The
  coupling is at the harness layer only, never the architecture.

### Migration
- Packages generated under ≤0.2.0 (AGENTS.md-canonical, agent-neutral handoff) remain valid — no schema,
  identifier, required-artifact, or handoff-manifest-shape change, so the validator accepts them
  unchanged. New packages emit a root `CLAUDE.md` containing `@AGENTS.md` as the loaded standing-context
  entry, plus Claude-Code-targeted handoff prompts. To bring an existing package forward, add a root
  `CLAUDE.md` whose body is `@AGENTS.md`.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-06-22

### Added
- **Execution-tracking layer (Tarseem-inspired).** New mechanical gate **`G-PROGRESS`** in
  `validate_package.py` (acceptance-audit coverage: when an audit is present, every `AC-` carries a verdict
  from {Met, Partial, Not-met, Pending}; SKIPs when no audit exists). New **acceptance audit**
  (`templates/acceptance-audit.template.md` — a derived close-out: criterion → verdict × evidence) and a new
  **agent-control surface** (`templates/agent-control.template.md` → package-root `AGENTS.md` + a `CLAUDE.md`
  shim, also emitted by `init_skill_repo.py`): the agent-neutral, ambient standing context (invariants +
  violation⇒ADR, hard constraints, conventions, and the tracking protocol). Evidence columns added to
  work-breakdown / status-report / acceptance-criteria; optional `evidence` on
  `acceptance-criterion.schema.json` and `acceptance_refs` on `execution-phase.schema.json`. Initial +
  follow-up handoff prompts gained the AC-first/test-first loop, the track-as-you-go cadence, and new
  situational prompts (phase-exit summary, acceptance audit, spike/experiment report, defect log). README
  flow diagram + `CLAUDE.md` + `quality-gates.md` updated (6 → 7 gates). (additive / MINOR)
- **Gate `G-SET`** in `validate_package.py`: every "Always" artifact must be present on disk or recorded in
  `manifest.json` `omitted_artifacts[]` with a reason; the manifest must exist; nothing it declares present
  may be missing. This closes the gap where a hollow package (charter + README only) passed validation
  because every other gate SKIPped on the absent input. Backed by the new
  `references/required-artifacts.json` (machine mirror of the Always class) and a new
  `tests/fixtures/incomplete-package/` regression fixture. (audit AUDIT.md F-01/F-05)
- **Continuous integration** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`): runs the validator test suite and validates the
  golden packages (valid, invalid, incomplete, demo) on every push/PR across Linux + Windows × Python
  3.9–3.12. (audit F-02)
- **Behavioral eval harness** (`evals/evals.json`, `evals/README.md`, `.github/workflows/eval.yml`): five
  with-skill/without-skill scenarios including a prompt-injection case, plus a scheduled, non-blocking
  eval-spec lint. (audit F-03)
- **`SECURITY.md`**: trust model, untrusted-content posture, and vulnerability reporting. (audit F-04)
- **`init_skill_repo.py --layout plugin|classic`** (default `plugin`): scaffolds a self-contained plugin
  bundle (`marketplace.json` + `plugin.json` + `plugins/<name>/SKILL.md`) that installs as a Claude Code
  plugin with no restructuring; `classic` keeps the older `skill/` + `commands/` layout. (audit F-08)
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `docs/install.md`, and `docs/design-decisions.md`.

### Security
- Treat the project brief and any file content as **untrusted data, not instructions** (OWASP LLM01): new
  operating principle 10 in `SKILL.md`, safeguard 18 in `references/safeguards.md`, and a handoff-screening
  step (`references/handoff.md`, gate `G-INJECT`). (audit F-04)
- `init_skill_repo.py` validates `--repo-name` as a single safe path segment and asserts the resolved target
  stays inside `--target-dir`, blocking path traversal (CWE-22). (audit F-09)

### Changed
- Repackaged Keystone as a self-contained **Claude Code plugin**. The skill and everything it reads or
  invokes at runtime (templates, schemas, scripts, the artifact catalog, logos) now live in one bundle at
  `plugins/keystone/`, and the repository is its own plugin marketplace (`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`).
- Install is now one step in Claude Code (`/plugin marketplace add` → `/plugin install`); the bundle is also
  portable as a standalone Agent Skill.
- Reframed the "thin wrapper" principle for the plugin model (the skill is the entry point inside Claude
  Code; the principle still governs external CLI/API/MCP/UI entry points).
- `quality-gates.md`: added the `G-SET` row and corrected mechanization labels — `G-TRACE` is now "Partly"
  (its behavior-bearing → `AC-` clause is judgment, not mechanized) and `G-COMPLETE` no longer claims to
  verify required-set membership (that is `G-SET`). (audit F-05)
- `SKILL.md`: dropped the non-recognized `compatibility:` frontmatter key (its content moved to a body
  **Requirements** line) and fixed the "GitHub CLT" → "GitHub CLI" typo. (audit F-07/F-11)
- `references/extension.md`: refreshed the stale `commands/` entry-point reference. (audit F-10)
- **Migration (MINOR):** `schemas/package-manifest.schema.json` `generation.mode` now matches the skill's
  invocation modes (`full | intake | plan | resume | update | stage:<id>`) instead of the divergent
  `quick/standard/deep/research/update/resume` enum. A manifest that recorded a removed value
  (`quick`/`standard`/`deep`/`research`) must switch to a real mode; manifests that omit `mode` are
  unaffected. (audit F-06)

### Fixed
- Self-containment: removed dangling runtime references to repo-root docs and the obsolete "vendor step";
  corrected a stale traceability-schema filename reference.
- `init_skill_repo.py` no longer crashes with `UnicodeEncodeError` on Windows consoles using a legacy code
  page — stdout/stderr are reconfigured to UTF-8 at startup.

### Removed
- Build-history documents from the initial side-task context (`adrs/`, `IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md`,
  `NAMING-OPTIONS.md`, `CRITICAL-REVIEW.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, `ACCEPTANCE-CRITERIA.md`) and the redundant
  standalone `commands/keystone.md` wrapper. Durable design rationale was distilled into
  `docs/design-decisions.md`.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-18

### Added
- Initial Keystone capability: the methodology, skill specification (`SKILL.md` + references), governance
  model, artifact templates, JSON schemas, the repository-bootstrap script, the package validator with its
  self-test, worked examples, and a demonstration generated package.
